> I enjoy books and conferences that Bruce Eckel does. When i approached “Atomic Scala” for the first time at the end of 2013 i was amazed. I’ve bought & read “Scala for the impatient” by Cay Horstmann up to this time, but i look at every Eckel’s book as a masterpiece. So, i was thrilled to buy and read it.
